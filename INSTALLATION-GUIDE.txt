3. booking-COMPLETE.html (rename to booking.html)
4. admin-COMPLETE.html (rename to admin.html)
5. profile-COMPLETE.html (rename to profile.html)
6. INSTALLATION-GUIDE.txt (this file)

🔧 INSTALLATION (5 MINUTES):
----------------------------

STEP 1: Delete old files from GitHub
   • Delete: index.html
   • Delete: booking.html
   • Delete: admin.html
   • Delete: profile.html

STEP 2: Upload new files
   • Upload database-manager.js (keep name as-is)
   • Upload index-COMPLETE.html → Rename to: index.html
   • Upload booking-COMPLETE.html → Rename to: booking.html
   • Upload admin-COMPLETE.html → Rename to: admin.html
   • Upload profile-COMPLETE.html → Rename to: profile.html

STEP 3: Update Firestore Rules (IMPORTANT!)
   1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   2. Select: ghana-salon-booking
   3. Firestore Database → Rules tab
   4. Replace with:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

   5. Click "Publish"

STEP 4: Test!
   1. Wait 1 minute for GitHub Pages deployment
   2. Clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+R
   3. Visit: https://theghostpacket.com/ghana-salon-booking/
   4. Open Console (F12)
   5. Should see:
      • "✅ Firebase initialized successfully!"
      • "📊 Database Manager loaded"
      • "🚀 Ghana Salon Booking System v2.2 Loaded"
      • "✅ Loaded 5 business cards"

STEP 5: Test booking
   1. Click "Book Appointment" on any business card
   2. Fill form and submit
   3. Check Firebase Console → Firestore Database
   4. See appointment in "appointments" collection!

✅ SUCCESS CHECKLIST:
--------------------
☐ database-manager.js uploaded
☐ All 4 HTML files renamed and uploaded
☐ Firestore rules published
☐ Homepage shows 5 business cards
☐ Console shows no errors
☐ Test booking created
☐ Data appears in Firebase!

🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING:
------------------
• Business cards not showing?
  → Check console for errors
  → Make sure database-manager.js is uploaded
  → Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

• Firebase errors?
  → Check Firestore rules are published
  → Check firebase-config.js has your credentials

• Booking not saving?
  → Check console for "appointmentsRef is not defined"
  → If you see this, database-manager.js is not loading
  → Check file name is exactly "database-manager.js"

📞 AFTER INSTALLATION:
---------------------
Reply with: "✅ All files uploaded!"

Then test and share:
• Screenshot of homepage with business cards
• Screenshot of console (F12)
• Screenshot of Firebase Console showing data

I'll verify everything is working! 🇬🇭✨
